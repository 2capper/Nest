2. **Pool Winner with 2nd Best RA/DIP** 🏆 POOL WINNER  
3. **Pool Winner with 3rd Best RA/DIP** 🏆 POOL WINNER

### Positions 4-6: Pool Runners-Up (ranked by overall RA/DIP)
The "best of the rest" - 2nd place teams from each pool:
4. **Pool 2nd Place with Best Overall RA/DIP** 🥈 POOL 2ND
5. **Pool 2nd Place with 2nd Best Overall RA/DIP** 🥈 POOL 2ND
6. **Pool 2nd Place with 3rd Best Overall RA/DIP** 🥈 POOL 2ND

### Positions 7+: Remaining Teams
All other teams ranked by traditional points system and tie-breakers.
